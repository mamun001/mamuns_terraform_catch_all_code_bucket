## This will eventually be organized by "type" and sorted by level of difficulty
## But right now, it is only divided into folder by cloud (aws/gcp) or provider (scalr/vault)

## terraform_code_examples_for_various_patterns ==> you will find code examples of patterns that repeat (e.g. for-each loop, dealing with maps etc.)
#

### You will some repeats of the codes between folders where the code set applies to both categories


##     How To Use This Repo
